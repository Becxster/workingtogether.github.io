                <h1>Some Activities to Try</h1>
                <p>Engaging in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) activities holds profound value both in
                    professional
                    endeavors and personal growth. In the professional realm, embracing DEI fosters innovation by
                    bringing
                    diverse perspectives to the table, enriching problem-solving processes, and enhancing creativity.
                    Moreover, it cultivates a workplace culture where all individuals feel valued, respected, and
                    empowered
                    to contribute their unique talents and insights. Beyond the office walls, practicing DEI principles
                    nurtures empathy, understanding, and mutual respect in personal interactions, leading to more
                    harmonious
                    relationships and a more inclusive society. By championing DEI initiatives, individuals not only
                    advance
                    their careers but also contribute to creating a world where everyone has the opportunity to thrive,
                    irrespective of their background or identity.</p>

                <sub>The truth is, many organizational-level biases go under the radar even though they are crucial for
                    fostering a fair and inclusive workplace.
                    These questions aim to uncover potential biases in hiring processes, representation in company
                    materials, and pay equity. Addressing these areas may help you discover improvements to create a
                    more equitable and transparent organization.</sub>

                        jobs? How might your organization’s processes give rise to biases from social connections in the
                        workforce that you hire? What formal procedures do you think might be adopted to avoid these

                        the company? What could be done to better showcase your organization?
                        <br><br>
                        3) How does your organization ensure that there are not gender or racial inequities in pay? Is
                        there pay transparency? If not, do they conduct salary studies within their organization? How
                        might you encourage them to do this?

                It's a good idea to think about how you can live up to the principles of DEI in your personal life.

                your actions (or inaction)
                may affect the attitudes and abilities of those around you. You can use the personal reflection

                        1) Consider the biases that you or someone you care about are experiencing at work. How are you
                        or your loved one dealing with them at present? What would be ideal? What are the advantages and
                        disadvantages of acting how you would ideally like to act? What is standing in your way?
                        <br><br>
                        2) Face the experience by directly naming it and acknowledging feelings. Consider sharing this
                        with the perpetrator. If this is too threatening and/or you fear retaliations, share the
                        experience with a family member, friend, co-worker, or counselor.
                        <br><br>

                        <br><br>
                        4) Consider keeping a journal to document not only the discriminatory behavior, but also
                        feelings about the transgressions. Ignoring discrimination can often be unhealthy. Name it and
                        use journaling to try to make sense of strategies that can be used to eliminate it and to
                        healthily interpret the problem and your reactions.
