                <p>Mikki and Eden have been happily "working together" for more than 25 years! Their journey began when
                    Eden was an undergraduate student at Rice and Mikki was a starting assistant professor. Little did
                    they know that they would both become chaired professors in the same department only two office
                    doors apart from each other. Together, they have focused their careers engaged in research that
                    tries to better highlight the workplace experiences of individuals who have marginalized social
                    identities. Additionally, their research focuses on ways to reduce the biases and discrimination
                    that individuals receive by identifying individual and organizational-level strategies. They look
                    forward to many, many more years of “working together” to create more fair, safer, and equitable
                    organizations, and they hope you will join them in this quest.</p>

                    <h2>Dr. Mikki Hebl</h2>
                    <p>Mikki Hebl is a full professor of psychology and management at Rice University. She is a proud
                        native of Pardeeville, Wisconsin, who graduated with her B.A. from Smith College and her Ph.D.
                        at Dartmouth College. She joined the faculty at Rice University in 1998 and was given the
                        endowed title of the Radoslav Tsanoff Assistant Professorship in 2000. Mikki is an applied
                        psychologist who is interested in the ways in which social psychological phenomena can be
                        applied to industries and organizations. Her research specifically focuses on workplace
                        discrimination and the barriers stigmatized individuals (such as women and ethnic minorities)
                        face in social interactions, the hiring process, business settings, and the medical community.
                        In addition, she addresses ways in which both individuals and organizations might remediate such
                        discrimination. She has more than 200 publications that include journal articles, book chapters,
                        and edited books. In addition to conducting basic research, she is very interested in presenting
                        her and others' related research findings to educate others and ameliorate disparate social
                        inequities. Mikki is also passionate about teaching--she has been the recipient of 15 major
                        teaching awards and was appointed "National Professor of the Year" in 2015.</p>
