                    <h2>Mikki Hebl</h2>
                    <p>Mikki Hebl is a full professor of psychology and management at Rice University. She is a proud
                        native of Pardeeville, Wisconsin, who graduated with her B.A. from Smith College and her Ph.D.
                        at Dartmouth College. She joined the faculty at Rice University in 1998 and was given the
                        endowed title of the Radoslav Tsanoff Assistant Professorship in 2000. Mikki is an applied
                        psychologist who is interested in the ways in which social psychological phenomena can be
                        applied to industries and organizations. Her research specifically focuses on workplace
                        discrimination and the barriers stigmatized individuals (such as women and ethnic minorities)
                        face in social interactions, the hiring process, business settings, and the medical community.
                        In addition, she addresses ways in which both individuals and organizations might remediate such
                        discrimination. She has more than 200 publications that include journal articles, book chapters,
                        and edited books. In addition to conducting basic research, she is very interested in presenting
                        her and others' related research findings to educate others and ameliorate disparate social
                        inequities. Mikki is also passionate about teaching--she has been the recipient of 15 major
                        teaching awards and was appointed "National Professor of the Year" in 2015.</p>
